Mobile devices are ubiquitous in the twenty-first century, and developing applications that work on them becomes ever harder and more complex, with more and more options for development. In this paper, we explore a particular method of developing mobile applications, that of the Progressive Web App (PWA), by creating a companion application for train trips.

In chapter one, we create an introduction of the subject, with some context in and around the theme, an outline of the goals of this thesis and related work.

In chapter two, we discuss at large the evolution of PWAs and how they trace back to the earliest computers, outlining the more important evolution milestones that shaped web applications into what they are today, providing comparisons between all applicable mobile architectures.

In chapter three, we outline a product design for our Train Companion application. We define a set of product requirements, and devise a use case diagram.

In chapter four, we detail how this application was implemented: what entities have been chosen and where (frontend/backend), how the travel data was handled and sourced, how the frontend and backend are architected and how these components work with one another.

In chapter 5, we provide a conclusion related to PWAs, and present in what ways they are better than native applications and in what ways they're worse.
